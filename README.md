# Nicasource Assessment

## Limitations and Scope

<p style="text-align: justify">The coding assignment involves developing a frontend using NextJS. Certain limitations need to be acknowledged. Notably, no pagination feature has been developed as it wasn't explicitly specified in the requirements. Additionally, to adhere to security best practices, some errors are intentionally kept non-verbose in the toasts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Feel free to tinker around and click everything. I've tried to mimic modern social media UX. So for example if you want to see a user's profile click on another user's name inside the video details. Want to see whose following you? Click on your followers.</p>
